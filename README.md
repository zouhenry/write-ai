# WriteAI
WriteAI is an open-source framework for automated grammar correction, writing quality assessment, and structured feedback generation using fine-tuned large language models. It performs sentence-level error detection and correction, computes quantitative writing quality scores based on detected error spans, and generates detailed, downloadable [PDF reports](https://github.com/whiteh4cker-tr/grammar-llm/blob/main/static/pdf/example-writing-quality-report.pdf) with highlighted differences between original and corrected text. Designed for reproducible experimentation and evaluation, WriteAI provides a REST API and web interface for integration into research workflows and supports CPU-based execution without requiring GPU resources.

2. **Paraphrase**
   - Rephrase your text in multiple styles:
     - **Corrected**: Grammar-corrected version
     - **Formal**: Professional and structured tone
     - **Casual**: Conversational and relaxed tone
     - **Concise**: Condensed and efficient version
   - Compare different writing styles side-by-side

3. **AI Chat**

## Deployment

### Docker Deployment

#### Using Docker Compose (Recommended)
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Electron Desktop App

#### Building the Desktop Application

The project includes an Electron app for desktop deployment. Build options are available for macOS, Windows, and Linux.

**Prerequisites:**
- Node.js and npm installed
- The FastAPI backend running (the Electron app connects to the local API)

**Build all platforms:**
```bash
cd electron-app
npm install
npm run build
```

**Platform-specific builds:**

**macOS (DMG):**
```bash
cd electron-app
npm run build:mac
```
The built app will be in `dist/WriteAI-1.0.0.dmg`

**Windows (NSIS Installer):**
```bash
cd electron-app
npm run build:win
```
The built app will be in `dist/WriteAI Setup 1.0.0.exe`

**Linux (AppImage):**
```bash
cd electron-app
npm run build:linux
```
The built app will be in `dist/WriteAI-1.0.0.AppImage`

**Run locally during development:**
```bash
cd electron-app
npm install
npm start
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/whiteh4cker-tr/grammar-llm.git
cd grammar-llm
```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage

1. Start the application:
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```
2. Open your browser and navigate to:
```text
http://localhost:8000
```

## Example Usage

### Web Interface
Simply paste or type your text in the editor and click "Check Grammar". The application will:
1. Analyze your text and display suggestions with highlighted differences
2. Calculate and display a writing quality score (0–100) based on the ratio of errors to total words
3. Provide a "Download Report" button to generate a PDF report containing:
   - Writing quality score
   - All suggestions with original and corrected sentences
   - Visual highlighting of error words (red) and corrections (green)
   - WCAG 2.0 AA compliant color contrast for accessibility

### API Usage
The application exposes a REST API for programmatic access:

```bash
# Send text for correction
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/correct" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "your text here"}'
```

### Using Python
```python
import requests, json

URL = "http://localhost:8000/correct"
payload = {"text": "She dont like the apples. this is a bad sentence"}

resp = requests.post(URL, json=payload, timeout=30)
resp.raise_for_status()
print(resp.status_code)
print(json.dumps(resp.json(), indent=2, ensure_ascii=False))
```

### 📦 Using Postman
- Method: POST
- URL: `http://localhost:8000/correct`
- Headers: `Content-Type: application/json`
- Body (raw → JSON): `"text": "She dont like the apples. this is a bad sentence" }`

#### Output (when corrections are suggested)
```json
{
    "suggestions": [
        {
            "original": "She dont like the apples. this is a bad sentence",
            "corrected": "She doesn't like the apples. This is a bad sentence",
            "sentence": "Sentence 1",
            "start_index": 0,
            "end_index": 48,
            "original_highlighted": "She <span class=\"error-word\">dont</span> like the apples. <span class=\"error-word\">this</span> is a bad sentence",
            "corrected_highlighted": "She <span class=\"corrected-word\">doesn</span><span class=\"corrected-word\">'</span><span class=\"corrected-word\">t</span> like the apples. <span class=\"corrected-word\">This</span> is a bad sentence"
        }
    ],
    "corrected_text": "She doesn't like the apples. This is a bad sentence"
}
```

#### Output (when input is already correct)
```json
{
    "suggestions": [],
    "corrected_text": "This is a good sentence. This is another good sentence."
}
```

## Configuration
The application uses the GRMR-V3-G4B-Q8_0 model by default. The model will be automatically downloaded on first run (approx. 4.13GB).

### Core Endpoints

**Grammar Correction Endpoint**
- **Endpoint**: POST `/correct`
- **Request Body**: `{"text": "your text here"}`
- **Response**: Returns a `CorrectionResponse` object containing:
  - `suggestions` (List[Suggestion]): a list of per-sentence suggestion objects. Each suggestion includes `original`, `corrected`, `sentence`, `start_index`, `end_index`, and HTML-highlighted fields (`original_highlighted`, `corrected_highlighted`). **Only sentences with a meaningful correction are included; `suggestions` may be empty.**
  - `corrected_text`: The fully corrected version of the input text (this field is always returned)

**Apply Suggestion Endpoint**
- **Endpoint**: POST `/apply-suggestion`
- **Use Case**: Apply a single suggestion to the original text
- **Request Parameters**: Original text, suggestion index, and suggestions list

**Apply Multiple Suggestions Endpoint**
- **Endpoint**: POST `/apply-suggestions`
- **Use Case**: Apply multiple suggestions to the original text at once
- **Features**: Handles overlapping suggestions intelligently by keeping the rightmost replacement
- **Note**: This endpoint is available for programmatic API clients. The web frontend applies suggestions one at a time using the `/apply-suggestion` endpoint instead.

**AI Chat Endpoint**
- **Endpoint**: POST `/chat`
- **Request Body**: `{"message": "your question", "history": []}`
